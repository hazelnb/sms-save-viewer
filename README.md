# Sunshine Scorecard

Are you on your 100th Mario Sunshine replay but somehow _still_ always miss one pesky blue coin? Just upload your `.gci`, `.gcs` or `.sav` save file and see exactly which coin it is in two possible numbering schemes. It also supports save files for Eclipse, which should be detected automatically. In addition to showing you which blues are missing, if you click on any blue coin, it will take you directly to the corresponding page.

It also would have been incredibly painful to create with out NokiDoki's [Sunshine Save Format Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/J48Gb31J) or the community [RAM Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElTW-akaTUF9OC2pIFR9-7aVPwpJ54AdEVJyJ_jvg0E/edit?usp=sharing). For vanilla blue coins, I link to the blue coin guides on the [Mario Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Sunshine) and [Mario Party Legacy](https://mariopartylegacy.com/guides/super-mario-sunshine-blue-coins-and-walkthrough). The Mario Wiki numbers also correspond to the numbers on some [amazing fan blue coin maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/j56j95/blue_coin_maps_for_mario_sunshine/). For Eclipse blues, I link to the relevant timestamps in [SUBWAY CIRCUIT](https://www.youtube.com/@subwaycircuit)'s YouTube guides.

Happy blue coin hunting!
